# Howto: Set up or update a reveal.js presentation with slides written in markdown

([how to install npm](./nodejs.md)).

Finally, start editing the `slides.md` file.

## Update reveal.js codebase

  ```sh
  fab setup.revealjs  -H localhost
  ```

When re-running the task `setup.revealjs`, you will be asked for to optionally
download the latest reveal.js codebase (everything in subdir `reveal.js` will
be replaced; other files in particular `slides.md` and `index.html` will not be
touched).

  ```sh
  fab setup.decktape  -H localhost
  ```

  ./phantomjs decktape.js --size 1280x800  localhost:8000  ~/repos/my_presi/my_presi.pdf
  ```
